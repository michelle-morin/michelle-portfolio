#### _Independent project for Epicodus_, _10 January 2020_

#### By _**Michelle Morin**_

## Description

_This webpage, available at [GitHub pages](http://michelle-morin.github.io/michelle-portfolio), serves as a landing page for my programming portfolio. The webpage includes a photo of myself and an "About Me" section describing my background (education and work experience), hobbies, interests, and skills. The webpage also includes a project directory describing some of the projects I completed thus far at Epicodus. Bootstrap version 3.3.7 and a custom stylesheet both style the webpage. Background images applied to the .jumbotron and .well classes are photos I captured in Bryce Canyon National Park in July 2019._
